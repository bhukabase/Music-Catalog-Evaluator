Project: Music Catalog Valuation Tool
Primary Goal: Create a web application that enables music rights holders to quickly analyze and project the value of their music catalogs using royalty statements and streaming data.

Core Functionality:

1. Data Input
- Users can upload multiple file types:
  * CSV files (streaming data)
  * PDF files (royalty statements)
  * Images (screenshots of dashboards)
- Drag-and-drop interface for file uploads
- Preview of uploaded files with ability to remove
- Support for batch uploads
- Progress indicator during file processing

2. Data Processing Backend
- Implement Claude AI integration for:
  * OCR processing of PDF statements and images
  * Natural language understanding of royalty statements
  * Data extraction and normalization
  * Pattern recognition across multiple statements
- Process streaming data:
  * CSV parsing with error handling
  * Data validation and cleaning
  * Automatic format detection
  * Cross-platform data normalization

3. Valuation Engine
- Configure standard valuation parameters:
  * Platform-specific payout rates (Spotify: $0.004, Apple Music: $0.01)
  * Platform stream ratios (Apple Music = 1/3 of Spotify)
  * Year-over-year decay rates:
    - Years 1-2: 30% decay
    - Years 3-4: 20% decay
    - Years 5+: 10% decay
- Implement projection models:
  * 7-year revenue forecasting
  * Platform-specific growth modeling
  * Risk-adjusted valuations
  * Historical performance analysis

4. Report Generation
- Create professional PDF reports including:
  * Executive Summary
  * Current Catalog Overview
    - Total tracks
    - Release timeline
    - Current revenue
    - Total streams
  * Future Projections
    - Year-by-year breakdowns
    - Platform-specific projections
    - Revenue forecasts
  * Top Performing Tracks
  * Risk Analysis
  * Methodology Explanation
- Include data visualizations:
  * Revenue projection charts
  * Historical performance graphs
  * Platform distribution analysis

5. User Interface
- Clean, professional design with:
  * Intuitive file upload area
  * Processing status indicators
  * Report preview
  * Export options
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet
- Print-optimized report styling

Technical Requirements:

1. Frontend
- React-based SPA
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Component library: shadcn/ui
- Data visualization: Recharts
- PDF generation capabilities
- File handling: drag-and-drop + traditional upload

2. Backend
- Claude AI integration for document processing
- Secure file handling
- Data processing pipeline
- CSV parsing with PapaParse

User Flow:
1. User arrives at landing page
2. Uploads royalty statements/streaming data through drag-and-drop or file selection
3. System displays uploaded files with option to remove/add more
4. User initiates analysis
5. Progress indicator shows processing status
6. System generates and displays report
7. User can preview, print, or download PDF version

Error Handling:
- Invalid file formats
- Corrupt data
- Processing failures
- API timeouts
- Memory limitations

Performance Requirements:
- File processing: < 30 seconds
- Report generation: < 15 seconds
- PDF export: < 5 seconds
- Supports up to 50MB total upload size
- Handles up to 1000 tracks per analysis

Future Considerations:
1. User accounts for saving reports
2. Template customization
3. Batch processing
4. Additional platforms integration
5. Custom valuation parameters
6. Historical report comparison

Please implement this system with a focus on reliability, accuracy, and user experience. The final product should feel professional and trustworthy while maintaining simplicity in use.
